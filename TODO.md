* Seminar

* MAYBE STEAL PRESENTATION STYLE/STRUCTURE
    * Presentation:
        - Introduction to DatalogMTL: Dataset, Program, Syntax (Example)
        - Difference to normal datalog: Nontermination due to infinite timepoints, recursion, etc...
        - Reductions from inconsistency(Consistency) to Fact entailment
            //- Intervals are partitions of timeline!!!!!!!
            //    * COMBINED COMPLEX
            //        - Transoformation ExpSpaceComplete!!! to Linear Timeline !!! (Interval 1.5 -> 1 usw..)
            //        =>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> OHH THATS WHERE THE ExpSpaceComplete comes from lmao
            //    * DATA COMPLX
            //        - Reudction to emptiness of Buechi Automata? PSAPCE COMPELETE
        - WHAT WE DID (!!!!!!)
        - Experiments results
            - Thorough explaination of results
        - SUMMARY STUFF FINAL


==============================================================
FUTURE WORKS:

* PERIODS DETCIONT
    - STOPPING CONDITION: MODULO SHIFTING OF SAME CONTENT HAPPENING INSIDE 2 INTERVALS FRM RULES APPLICA.





===============================================================

- [ ] TAGGING FOR VERSION CONTROL COORESPODS TO REPORT
- [ ] LINK IN REPORT

===============================================================

4 Phases: LOAD, REASONING, HYPER-GRAPH PARSER, EVEE

- [x] TIME FOR EACH.
- [ ] SVG FOR 2 iter case 4

================================================================
- [ ] Negative body in parse program?
- [ ] Consistency check in pipeline should be negated?
