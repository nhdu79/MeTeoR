* IProof
    * Rules are inferences with head, name, body
    * Facts are empty inferences with "asserted" name
    * Facts are generic data struct.

Priority:
[x] Split Since
[ ] JSON parse?

Later:
[ ] Java Algo
[ ] Mb Tests but after the algorithm

* OLD ======================================
[x] Since/Until nested
[x] Nested rules for head
[x] Rules at the end for deriving the atom
[x] Fix colaesce
[x] Split Temporal rules into 2
[x] Nested rules
[x] Edge case where interval-borders meet
[x] Change name rules to ops
